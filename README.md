A pool-of-Concept to demonstrate how you can make Elections,referenda and polls process more secure , reliable, and transparent.
As we know Blockchain is a transparent and verifiable system which will change th way people think about exchanging data.

During previous days they were using ballot papers for elections and later they introduced a digital method by using EVM machines. These machines store the data in the machine itself which is easy to make gmabling. It does not contain any log. So, now we are going to introduce blockchain technoology to make these transactions more secure.

Now in this process I am going to create a blockchain for storing the data sets/assets which cointains secure log of transactions and is more secure cannot be easily gambled. Creating an interface and connecting it to a blockchain each time a vote has been voted it directly reflects to the blockchain and automatically produce reports based on it.
Therfore, using blockchain makes more secure and relaible for handling the secured data.
